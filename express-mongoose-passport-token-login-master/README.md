=====================================

## Synopsis

User Session and Token authentication node.js app with express 4, mongoose, passport, passport-local, passport-local-mongoose, express-session and csurf. 

## Motivation

Authentication is one of the most important parts of any web application. Implementing proper authentication system for any application can be a difficult task and Node.js applications are no exception to this. To address security concerns of exposing a user's login information, this example uses sessions and tokens authentication methods. It can be used as boilerplate for Node.js projects using Express 4, MongoDB, Passport, Express Session and Csurf REST API Auth Tokens.

This example uses the following flow of control:

The user provides a user password and email in the login panel and clicks Sign In. The email provided will be used for further session tracking of information that is needed to persist throughout the user's interaction with the web application. Instead of storing information via cookies in the user's browser, only a unique identifier is stored on the client side (called a "session id"). This session id is passed to the server every time HTTP or AJAX request is made. The Node.js app pairs this session id with it's database (in our case MongoDB) and retrieves the stored variables for use by the requested page. Using Express Session middleware takes the complexity away and makes it simple to get sessions up and running in no time. 

After a request is complete, the server reports back on the request's success or failure user validation. If the request is valid, token is created using the user information fetched from the database, and then returned inside the view (ejs template engine is demonstrated here). The token value is set as the value of a hidden input field. Tokens are added to requests which mutate state and validated against the visitor's session. Only if correct token is present and correct, changes will be applied, otherwise the request will be rejected. Token information is provided only in POST requests for accessing restricted endpoints in the application, since GET requests can leak the token to different places (browser history, log files, etc.). The CSURF middleware provides easy-to-use protection against CSRF/XSRF attacks.

Once user logs out, session will be destroyed and user will be redirected to home page.

This app provides a "Remember Me" feature that saves the user's session data allowing them to bypass the login screen whenever they revisit the site (their authenticated state is persisted beyond the immediate scope of use). If "Remember me" checkbox on the login page is selected, the session expiration will be extended to a week and otherwise it is just treated as a normal window session that does not have an explicit expiration date and will therefore forcibly expire when the browser is closed. 

This app also features 'Forgot Password' functionality that allows users to reset existing password to a new value. Users are required to navigate to the 'Forgot Password' page and enter their email (which is unique) to request a password reset. Then an email in plain-text with temporary password-reset token will be sent to the user email account (this is done using "express-mailer" module). User use the temporary token to resets their password.

By employing the practice of progressive enhancement the app honours accessibility while taking advantage of cutting edge technology. Itâ€™s the best of both worlds.

## Prerequisites

* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - Since this project is scaffolded with mongoose, we need mongoDB to be installed and have the `mongod` process running.

## Installation

Once you have forked this project, go ahead and install our dependencies by simply typing the following line in your terminal:

```js
npm install
```
Now let's start the app:
```js
npm start
```
And here is how you run the app in production mode:
```js
node_env=PRODUCTION npm start
```

## Demo

Demo of the app can be found on Heroku:
